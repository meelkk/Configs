# Configs 

If you want to use my configs make sure to remove the config you're actually using in your tf/csgo/l4d2 folder.

There might can be outdated commands, execs and scripts in l4d2 and tf2 config. 

For any problems regarding scripts/execs/commands I recommand you to go on teamfortress.tv or hltv.org 

All CFGs are updated since February 02 2018. Enjoy!
